                <p>"Born and raised in Denver, Colorado. In my free time I love to travel, I’ve been all over the U.S. and four countries. I want to eventually visit every National Park in the United States and visit South America and Africa. When I’m not traveling I enjoy riding my motorcycle through the mountains, and I am also a trained Luthier. I’ve built around a dozen guitars both electric and acoustic, I turned my garage into a wood shop. I also enjoy playing guitar I have my own personal studio. Music really is my passion."

                <P>"I would love to take this knowledge of being a full stack developer to someday make it my career. I’ve been in the construction industry for 13 years but It’s definitely time for a change. I love how you can start with an empty computer screen and create a masterpiece. It’s the creative nature of the industry that really excites me. "
